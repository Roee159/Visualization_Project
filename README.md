# Visualization of the Olympics Games 1894-2016 

## Overview

This is a web application built with JavaScript and d3.v4 library to provide users with a platform for exploration of the history of Olympic games data between 1894-2016.

The dataset we are going to use is 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results. The dataset is extracted from Kaggle and contains data about the athletes that have taken part in the Olympics (summer and winter) from 1896 to 2016. The data contains over 270k entries corresponding to an athlete participating in any sportive event. Details we can extract from the data are Name, Year, NOC (National Olympic Committee), Sport, Event, and Medal among others.

## Features

The application allows users access to several visualizations while the main one is the world map showing them the achievements of each country in each Olympics with the option to filter the information by year of competition and by season (summer/winter).

The second visualization makes in-depth use of the information we received. It analyzes the achievements in each of the sports that were contested in the competition that the user selected. What allows the audience to draw more specific conclusions allows in general for each country.

In the last visualization, we want to emphasize an important issue: The gender gap between the athletes participating in the Olympics over the years. You can see a global trend on the subject and a promising result already in the upcoming competition.
